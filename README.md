##Rapid creation of printable certificates using Acrobat Javascript
<p>A dynamic template for certificates of completion I created for a trainer in my department. She needs to send PDFs to our print shop so I combined a standard PDF template with some groovy javascript and hidden buttons so she can rapidly create many pages/certs in a single PDF without removing her hands from the keyboard (stopping to use the mouse adds a lot of wasted time and effort). Another wee feature is she can either let the PDF insert today's date automatically or she can type in a date if she's creating a cert after the fact.</p>
